libFNR - A reference implementation library for FNR encryption scheme.

FNR represents "Flexible Naor and Reingold"

FNR is a small domain block cipher for encrypting
objects ( < 128 bits ) like IPv4, MAC, Credit Card numbers, Time Stamps etc.

## INSTALL

NOTE : openssl latest version (> openssl-1.0.1e) needs to be installed

```shell
# The bootstrap.sh step is only ncessary if you are building from a
# git clone; it is not necessary if you are building from a libfnr
# tarball.
$ bootstrap.sh

$ ./configure --enable-debug=yes
$ make
```

## RUN

```shell
$ cd test
$ ./ipv4test -p password -t  tweak -f raw-ips
```

IMPORTANT:  This is an *experimental* cipher, not for production yet.
